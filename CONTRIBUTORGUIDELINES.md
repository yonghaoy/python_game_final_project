#Tools and their use
Life at UNC was created using Python script [https://www.python.org/downloads/] and the Pygame modules [http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml].
Your machine may have Python on it already, but you *must* download Pygame to work with our code.
We recommend using the open source tools GIMP [http://www.gimp.org/] for image creation and Tiled [http://www.mapeditor.org/] for mapt tileset graphics.
Check your code locally on your machine before pushing to your branch (more on that below) and opening a pull request.

#File structure
Follow the conventions for storing and organizing files (or work on your own branch and make a note of why you think a change is necesary).
Sprites, Audio, Tilesets, etc. are in their own folders.

#Branching
Please work on your own branch! Do NOT work directly on the master branch. Heads may explode.

#Pull requests
Submit a pull request with your work, with adequate documentation/comment of what you have done with the code.
Let somebody else look over your work and do the merging.
Flag your pull requests and issues with appropriate milestones.

#Etc.
Be polite and have fun with the project!
We look forward to working with you.
