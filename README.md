# Life at UNC
## INLS 560 final project

This project is a set of games written in Python using Pygame. Guide Rameses the Ram
to a number of locations around UNC to initiate various arcade-style games!

## Credits / Source Code modified

Our "main" game is adapted from Iury Alvares's RPG-Pygame project 
(protected under MIT license; https://github.com/IuryAlves/RPG-Pygame).
This is the code we have most extensively reworked, with new player icons,
map, and event triggers.
Our "sub" game arcade games are from Al Sweigart (http://inventwithpython.com/pygame), 
protected under simplified BSD license. We have modified these games to have a Carolina theme/feel.
We have used the Pygame library, GIMP, and Tilex to create this project.
